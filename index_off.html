      <h3>I've strategized, researched, designed, developed and launched experiences for over 10 years in a variety of capacities.</h3>
      <h3>I've worked with teams, brands and products small and large.</h3>
      <h3>I've managed, lead and been an integral part of multiple teams.</h3>
      <h3>I've collaborated with a diverse set of roles, from account teams to HR departments to client stakeholders.</h3>
      <h3>I don't bullshit; I disdain unproductive meetings; I despise moving slow.</h3>
      <h3>I like to design in code; I enjoy rapidly built prototypes; I am always hungry for more research and opinions to help shape my own perspectives.</h3>
      <h3>In my personal time, I enjoy photography, golf, sailboats, road trips, cooking and discovering new music.</h3>

    <h2>Over the years, I've scratched a few itches of my own. Each of the examples below were designed and developed by yours truly (unless noted otherwise). Consider them all a work in progress.</h2>
    
    <h3><a href="#itches" class="open">Check them out &darr;</a></h3>

    <div id="itches" class="section">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/joshellington/BPM">BPM</a>
          <p>I attempt to make music in my spare time and always struggled with finding a simple BPM tapper to match up samples and the like. So I built BPM, a super duper simple iPhone app that allows me to tap and get a BPM measurement within a few seconds. This one allowed me to get my hands dirty with some Objective-C and become a bit more familiar with Xcode. Launching soon.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="http://yhack.net">yhack.net</a>
          <p>Hacker News's site design hurts my head and eyes, so I a responsive site that cleans things up a bit. Another Ruby-based scraping experiment, with this one allowing me to work with Redis.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/joshellington/Cronwall">Cronwall</a>
          <p>Constantly searching for and downloading desktop wallpapers seemed like a waste of time, so I built Cronwall, a Ruby-based cron task that goes out and automatically does it for me. It's set to the good, publicly-available Tumblr sites I frequent.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/joshellington/Vidembed">Vidembed</a>
          <p>After looking for YouTube and Vimeo parsing regexes on Stack Overflow for the umpteenth time, I decided to build this jQuery plugin to keep it all in one place. It also supports Instagram and Facebook embeds. Nothing fancy, but it works.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="http://apod.joshellington.com">APOD Viewer</a>
          <p>An experiment that combined my love for scraping public data and space. One of my first forays into building a Ruby-based web application with Heroku.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="http://neue.joshellington.com">Rdio Neue</a>
          <p>As an avid (and early beta tester) of Rdio, I found myself spending too much time every Tuesday (new release day) trying to discover new music that I liked. So, I built this experiment to remove the mouse and allow a keyboard-driven navigation system. This one also helped me explore integrating OAuth into a Ruby web app.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="http://adventuresinspace.com/">Adventures In Space</a>
          <p>An inspiration blog built with Wordpress and containing 7,500+ unique pieces of content with associated images. Built in collaboration with <a href="http://craigsprecher.com">Craig Sprecher</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="http://systematic.herokuapp.com/">Systematic</a>
          <p>An early Sinatra experiment that generates a unique URL with your browser's current setup.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="http://phonehome-app.herokuapp.com">Phonehome</a>
          <p>Frustrated with sending links to my phone over email and other clunky ways, I built this itty bitty web app/bookmarklet combo to SMS me the current page I'm viewing. Utilizes more Ruby and some Twilio integration.</p>

    <h4><span></span> Recent commercial work</h4>

    <h2>During my recent tenure with <a href="http://roundhouseagency.com">Roundhouse</a>, I worked on a wide variety of projects in a wide variety of roles. I was an early part of the core culture and helped grow the company from a small, less than 10 person agency, to a well-respected force in the industry.

I worked closely with our creative and strategy teams in creating the key concept and collaborated closely with the adidas.com technical team to design and implement a completely new pre-sale platform that integrated directly with their ecomm system. We owned the strategy, UX, design and development of the platform from start to finish. The platform went on to support multiple launches over the coming months.</p>
