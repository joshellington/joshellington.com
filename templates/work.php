    <h2>During my recent tenure with <a href="http://roundhouseagency.com">Roundhouse</a>, I worked on a wide variety of projects in a wide variety of roles. I was an early part of the core culture and helped grow the company from a small, less than 10 person agency, to a well-respected force in the industry. Below are a few short writeups on some of the projects I played a key role in.</h2>

I spearheaded and helped implement an application architecture that allowed us to serve over 15 million concurrent users at once without a single second of downtime. We worked closely with outside vendors to maintain and moderate the live social feeds within the in-house designed and developed physics-based data visualization.</p>
