Tow company is coming tomorrow to take my Jeep for the Make a Wish foundation. Had some good adventures in that thing. Hope it‚Äôll bring a little help to the foundation.</p>\n\n<p>Heading to La Pine/Deschutes area for camping tonight. Should be an easy 220 mile trek with good weather and decent camping options. Still undecided for tomorrow night. So many options around the Shasta area. Need to figure out my non-I5 route through northern Cali. The adventure begins :)</p>\n\n<p>1708\n<br />Camp is setup. Made it to my target, Fall River CG. Have the entire place to myself. Right next to the lazy river. Little bit of occasional road noise, but not bad. Figure it‚Äôll quiet down later.</p>\n\n<p>Running into La Pine now to get supplies. Firewood, water, dinner, and whiskey.</p>\n\n<p>2136\n<br />Tired as hell. Didn‚Äôt eat enough this morning and felt it. Scarfed down a small pizza at Ponderosa Pizza north of La Pine for dinner (saved a slice for breakfast). Town has some rough edges, but decent vibes. Lots of Harleys and Gold Wings out. Only saw one KLR, on the back roads.</p>\n\n<p>Was able to scavenge wood for a decent fire. Must have cleared some trees at the campground, leaving a bunch of downed scraps. Broke down pretty easily. Those Vaseline cotton balls are as good as advertised. Popped two inside a teepee formation with a little base and had a strong fire in five minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Heading into Cali tomorrow. Have a few potential camp spots targeted east of Mount Shasta, but am going to stop in Klamath Falls to get some WiFi, lunch, and a better look.</p>\n\n<p>Felt a huge difference riding when my blood sugar and hydration levels were up. Need to keep on that. Bought a gallon of water for my hydration pack. And will be eating a good breakfast of leftover pizza, granola bars, and coffee.</p>\n\n<p>Stoked to hear everyone is loving the map/site I built. Have a couple ideas for improvements I‚Äôm going to work on during my motel stay this weekend. Better segment days and include these journal entries somehow.</p>\n\n<p>Fire is about dead and my sleeping bag sounds better than ever. Will keep chasing the road in the morning ‚úåüèª\n</p>",

Tomorrow‚Äôs storm looks like the real deal, with an inch predicted everyone around here. Figure I‚Äôll get a shower, relax tomorrow morning and hopefully make a run for a campsite after lunch. If it‚Äôs not pouring sideways üòï.</p>\n\n<p>Worst case scenario, I stay two nights in Susanville (only $65/night) and hit the road hard on Saturday morning. Not the end of the world, especially with the holiday weekend traffic/crazies coming out. Might as well bunker down a bit versus fighting people for decent campsites.</p>\n\n<p>1313\n<br />At Burney Falls, some memorial state park. Pretty par for the course, except the waterfalls are the real deal. You‚Äôre able to walk right down damn near under em. And today there was only a handful of other people. If I didn‚Äôt have to ride another 90 minutes I would have jumped in. The 1.5 miles loop back trail was pretty decent too.</p>\n\n<p>Just had a sandwich from the general store here. Decent people, but somehow didn‚Äôt know how to make a damn sandwich haha. $9 on top of that. Skipped the Clif bars, they wanted $3.75 for one! Thankfully Red Bull was normal price. Need that caffeine to push me into Susanville.</p>\n\n<p>Hoping the wind isn‚Äôt too crazy getting out of here. Not fun stuck behind a semi going 65 with side gusts for an hour straight. Survive and advance.</p>\n\n<p>2003\n<br />Lassen Ale Works might have the best fish and chips I‚Äôve ever had. And their fried pickles are no joke. Was surprised to find it almost full on a Thursday night.</p>\n\n<p>Motel is perfect for $65/night. Got my bike under the awning, AC pumping, and good hot shower pressure. Glad I made the call to push through to Susanville.</p>\n\n<p>Likely be going to sleep early and sleeping in. They have good dark curtains and a decent bed. No clue what tomorrow holds.

BBQ brisket sandwich with pickles and grilled onions. This little highway town has some charm to it. Couple cool vintage-y motels and multiple weird flea market/random shit shops. Like a wide variety of metal dinosaur sculptures.</p>\n\n<p>Met a friendly Aussie (aren‚Äôt they all?), Gino, at Hallelujah Junction up 395 before Reno. Was riding a pretty Africa Twin, all loaded up, headed north. Showed me recent pictures of his runs across Sonora and Tioga passes, and his work in progress Butler map. I told him not to split too many lanes up in Oregon or Washington. He‚Äôs headed to meet his wife in Seattle and then running up to Alaska. Might have to do that next year.</p>\n\n<p>Going to drink my two Coors Lights I paid way too much for on this comfy bed and watch some sports.

Only a ~35 min ride from Walker. Made it up to the campground by 11, but was already almost full, no view, and gnarly rocky roads in and out. Overweight Karen did not like. But, on the way in I noticed a couple pull offs with great views of the mountains. Backtracked a bit and found one that‚Äôs just about perfect. Little close to the road, but about one car an hour so far today. And the openness and views are amaaaazing.</p>\n\n<p>After I setup camp, I ran down into Bridgeport for supplies and food. Had a super good burger at The Barn right downtown. And their fries were on the money.</p>\n\n<p>Made my way back to camp and caught a rain shower right as I was getting close. Pulled everything in the tent and gave Karen her tarp. Really really glad I brought the two person tent. Fits all my stuff easily with plenty of room for moving around.</p>\n\n<p>Now I‚Äôm kicking back and getting the rest day I‚Äôve been putting off for the last two days.

It feels like you‚Äôre in a prehistoric time or Bob Ross painting, minus the crazy four year olds screaming haha.</p>\n\n<p>Came through and stopped at Tunnel View. Wasn‚Äôt too crowded.

And now he wanders around in his Honda Odyssey, going to blues festivals and national parks all year. Doesn‚Äôt sound too bad.</p>\n\n<p>When I got closer in to the lodge and everything, I was a bit overwhelmed with all the options. So I decided to run over to the Lower Falls area. Saw there were a couple easy to moderate hikes around there. Did the Lower Falls, which was more of a quick walk down a sidewalk haha. And then walked over to the Upper Falls trail and did that. Woo, that one was a bit harder haha. Could tell I was still a bit out of shape. Made it up to Columbia Rock and it was totally worth it. The view was absolutely breathtaking. Had a 270 degree view of the valley, from the falls side.</p>\n\n<p>After I made my way down, I laid in the middle meadows area for a bit, before going to the food court for a deserved burger.

About 15 miles outside of Caliente, Google Maps put me on a dirt/sand/gravel road for 40 miles! At first I was dreading it a bit, but after I realized I could hold 40mph easy, it turned into fun. Dodging giant rocks the size of my head, climbing quick 30% grade hills, and realizing I was about 15 miles from anyone each direction. The KLR ate it up. Was finally glad I put the 50/50 tires on. Been doubting those on every highway, but they paid off today. Gripped the hell out of that road.</p>\n\n<p>Once I got back on pavement, now in Utah, I stopped in town to get my bearings. And realized I‚Äôm in Mormon country on a Sunday haha. Gas stations were closed, roads empty, and a general sense of eeriness. Finally found a grocery market open outside of camp, where I helped myself to a pulled pork sandwich right out of the consumer-style slow cooker. Slammed it full and proceeded to scarf it down in less than 5 minutes. Not bad for a $5 sandwich.</p>\n\n<p>Going to do a 2-mile hike once the sun calms down and the wind comes out to play. The park ranger lady said it has the best view, and starts right outside the campground. Stoked for that.</p>\n\n<p>As far as tomorrow, not sure yet. Was thinking about either getting all the way to Jacob‚Äôs Lake, north of North Rim, and camping in the forest there. Or possibly see if I can snag a fancy campsite at Demotte, even closer. But, I‚Äôm also considering getting over to Zion NP and seeing if I can get anything there. I‚Äôm so damn close, and I‚Äôll probably regret not stopping. We‚Äôll see how the body feels in the morning. Think this shower at about 930 tonight will help üôÇ.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, also, I broke 20k miles on the KLR! Bought it with 6.5k. Started the trip at 18,400. Almost up to 2k miles for the trip üòé.\n</p>",

Hoping they sell whiskey in Arizona at the gas station üòú.</p>\n\n<p>Crazy wind again today. Got a late start and paid for it. 30-40mph gusts across open desert. Kept under or right at the speed limit all day.</p>\n\n<p>Plan is to hit the hay early, get up early, and get south towards the Grand Kahuna. Hike around there and explore all day.

Lots of backcountry twisties through East Tennessee, up into North Carolina, and then back down into South Carolina. Beautiful scenery and tough roads.</p>\n\n<p>Helped an older lady put some air in her tires at a small gas station just before North Carolina. Was from Illinois and was going to visit her brother and mother. Reminded me of my Nana. Sweet as can be. She said she doesn‚Äôt understand why the heck anyone would want to live out here though. Been rained on the last 4 days straight haha. Tried turning down the $5 she handed me, but I‚Äôve learned you can only resist so much with nice ladies like that.</p>\n\n<p>Getting some much needed rest in this comfy bed tonight. Going into town tomorrow to get some bike stuff and supplies for Karen and I, along with getting the oil changed in Gammy‚Äôs car. Might squeeze a haircut in there too. This buzz cut is starting to turn into something weird haha.\n</p>",

Been at my aunt and uncle‚Äôs here outside of Greenville the last couple days, relaxing, visiting with family, and eating way too much haha.</p>\n\n<p>On Friday I went into town and found some oil, a filter, fresh chain lube, and camping supplies. Then met up with my Uncle Jonni for lunch at this awesome taco place in Greenville. Chased three giant tacos down with a local IPA and made my way back to the house to work on the bike.</p>\n\n<p>Started getting the oil changed on the bike, as I‚Äôve done multiple times before, and got to reinstalling the oil filter cover. Tiny 8mm fastener bolts hold the cover in place for the o-ring inside. Installed the first fine, then snapped the second ü§¨. Right off at the recessed part. Tried getting an edge to turn it, with no luck.</p>\n\n<p>With it such a small bolt in such a delicate area, I had zero confidence in tapping it out myself. Not without potentially ruining the threads or worse, penetrating the case cover itself. So, started looking for a professional to look at it. Not much to find on a Friday evening, so I wrapped everything up and tried to get some sleep.</p>\n\n<p>Next morning, my cousin Cary helped find a local guy who does custom bikes. Took it over to him and within 5 minutes he knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be an easy out option. He would want to get the whole case cover off and get it up on a drill press to make sure nothing else gets screwed up. And he was booked two weeks out. But, he said as long as the seal is strong (which it is), I should be fine.</p>\n\n<p>Felt a little better getting another opinion that it should be alright. For peace of mind, decided to get some RTV (sealant) to help keep that oil in there. Before starting on all of that, I went and hit a round of golf with my cousins and spent a relaxing night watching the Beavs get to the CWS finals! Much needed stress reliever.</p>\n\n<p>Today, my uncle ran me around to the hardware stores to track down RTV, new M6 bolts for my skid plate, and new hosing I found needed replacing. Got everything installed, chain lubed, and we‚Äôre ready to go. Will be keeping a very close eye on that filter cover and my oil levels to make sure nothing is sneaking out. Feeling confident it‚Äôll be alright.</p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs been so great to get back to family for a bit. My aunt and uncle have spoiled me with a fridge full of beer, homemade meals, and great company. Looking forward to getting back down here.</p>\n\n<p>Next big stop is Portland, Maine! Going to start heading that direction tomorrow morning, hoping to get there by the 2nd or 3rd of July. Should have plenty of time to stick to the backroads and be able to wander a little bit. Excited to see the ocean and be with friends for the 4th üòÅ. Onward!\n</p>",

Quickly realized the kickstand itself was bent to hell where the bolt mounts it to the bike. Super ugh. This thing is pretty heavy duty and wasn‚Äôt going to bend back (and in the right direction) without a decent amount of force and/or heat. So I packed it up and headed back to the motel.

Glad I got there early-ish in the morning though. On my way back down I passed at least a dozen groups making their way up. And the parking lot was completely full.</p>\n\n<p>Came back to camp after the hike and relaxed for a bit. Then jumped on the bike and headed into town for the so-called ‚Äúworld famous‚Äù fish and chips. They were pretty good. Not quite sure they were $18 good, but with it literally being the only place serving food within 60 miles, I can‚Äôt complain too much. Wandered around town for a bit, mostly to avoid the mosquitos back at camp.</p>\n\n<p>The OEM rear tire I had put on in Oklahoma is already almost worn out üòî. Not very surprised, but still annoyed. Should have enough tread left to get to my sister‚Äôs outside Lansing, Michigan, where I have a new one waiting. Was hoping I‚Äôd make it back to Oregon before shelling out another $150 for a new rear and install. Other than that, the bike has been running strong. Will climb any hill and run through any giant pothole without complaining. Which there are plenty of up here in snow country. Thought the roads were rough in Arizona and Mississippi, but I think Maine and Ontario are now leading the pack on worst condition public roads.</p>\n\n<p>Heading west of Sudbury today to find a cheap-ish motel to get a shower and recharge batteries. And hide from the mosquitos for a night, haha. Still deciding whether I stay an extra day or two in Ontario, or get across the border sooner than later. We‚Äôll see üôÇ.\n</p>",

The agent was definitely curious what the hell I was doing on my bike so far from Oregon, haha.</p>\n\n<p>Awesome ride coming into Michigan. Well besides the Mackinac bridge. Construction forced one lane closed and required you to drive on a gnarly grated section that had my 21 inch skinny front tire diving left and right all over the place. Held on for dear life and made it through.</p>\n\n<p>Stayed the night in Gaylord, Michigan, a Bavarian-style resort town that had some character. Found a great BBQ place with craft beers down the street from my motel. Ate a huge brisket sandwich and wandered to the dive bar down the street to see what the locals were up to.</p>\n\n<p>Took off this morning around 10 and started heading south towards my sister‚Äôs place outside Lansing. Made it about 25 miles until the wind picked up like crazy. Almost blown off the road twice and decided to pull over and evaluate things. Couldn‚Äôt find another route outside the wind and I was going to find thunderstorms further south, in addition to the wind. Saw a motel about 100 yards away and decided to call it for the day. Wind is supposed to be dead tomorrow. Going to hit the road early and hopefully avoid too many rain showers.</p>\n\n<p>Bit of a bummer to lose a day, but I just did not feel comfortable fighting those 30mph+ winds for another 3.5hrs.

That turned into quite the adventure itself.</p>\n\n<p>By the time I got to my sister‚Äôs, my chain was about to fall off and my rear tire was about to the threads. Thought they‚Äôd have to come pick me up 15 miles outside of town, haha. Ordered up a new chain and sprockets, which would take a couple days to arrive. But kept busy and had tons of fun with my 3 year old nephew Joey, and meeting my 2 month old nephew Jaytin.</p>\n\n<p>When I went to take off the old rear sprocket I managed to strip the hell out of two of the nuts üòî.

First time riding in the dark the whole trip! Figured it was worth it. Otherwise I would have had to run down around Chicago and fight traffic and construction and boringness.</p>\n\n<p>Made two adjustments to my ride that already seem game-changing. First, I bought a pair of low profile wireless earbuds to listen to music in my helmet. Not a huge fan of the idea, as I figured it would be more distracting than anything else. But with all the open plains riding I have coming, I needed something. And it‚Äôs been great today. More relaxing than anything. Keeps my mind from focusing on how far I‚Äôve gone and how much further I have. We‚Äôll see how it holds up over the next couple days.</p>\n\n<p>The other big change was long overdue. Moved my backpack off my back and onto my rear rack. Little more wind drag and height behind me, but the freedom of movement and lack of constant shoulder/back pressure already seems like a huge improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Still deciding on what‚Äôs next. Debating on whether to head to Devil‚Äôs Lake outside Madison, Wisconsin for a couple days of camping or get further west and do a quick motel. I‚Äôll decide in the morning üôÇ.</p>",

Super tough scrambling up/down slick rock steps and through loose pine needles/dirt with traffic. Need to do more of that.</p>\n\n<p>Turning 30 tomorrow! Been spending a bit of the day reflecting on my 20s. Crazy how much has happened and how far I‚Äôve come since 20, living in my parent‚Äôs farm house with about $20 in my bank account, kicked out of college, no job, no clue what to do next. Makes me feel extremely grateful for the luck and support I‚Äôve received over the last 10 years.

Right outside of Sturgis, home of one of the largest biker rallies in the world. 99% of them fit the classic ‚Äúbiker on a Harley‚Äù style. Leather vest and chaps, bandana, no helmet, goatee/beard, and possibly a woman riding on the back who you would not want to cross. But I‚Äôve also seen every shape and size and age of biker out there. Nice ladies in their 60s, young guys with full face helmets, gloves, and other smart safety gear. They‚Äôre also a lot friendlier than they look. I‚Äôve received a decent amount of waves on the road, and some warm gas station conversations. Especially when they notice I‚Äôm literally the only one out here on a 650cc single-cylinder dual sport bike, haha. I‚Äôve seen probably 1,000 bikes the last couple days, but not one other KLR! Can count on one hand the number of adventure BMWs. But I didn‚Äôt mind.</p>\n\n<p>Camped the last two nights in the Badlands Wilderness, just outside Badlands National Park and a small charming town called Wall, South Dakota. The campsite I found was amaaazing. 10mins from town, 5mins from the National Park, private 270 degree view looking down into a canyon with dramatic cliffs, rolling hills, and vast plains. And it was free! Had a couple neighbors and a few late arrivals try and sneak in my area, but everyone was super nice and it was extremely quiet. Yesterday I sat in my chair and read a book for about 7 hours straight, completely melted in the view (and also the sun with no shade, haha). Highly highly recommend the Badlands.</p>\n\n<p>Today I rolled through the park at a leisurely pace and made my way up to Rapid City. Easy ride, but I knew I needed to figure out how to get my oil changed, especially before getting up into the mountains. Have been feeling the symptoms grow this last week.</p>\n\n<p>Was a bit of an adventure tracking down the specific oil I needed and then figuring out how I was going to drain and dispose of the old oil. Thankfully Walmart had a perfect match and exactly the number of quarts I needed (3). Then was able to find an O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs that would let me use a loaner oil pan and then recycle the oil for me. Had the oil changed in about 15 minutes in the O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs parking lot. Nothing broke or went wrong this time, too! Haha.</p>\n\n<p>Getting back on the road tomorrow morning, headed to Casper, Wyoming. Seems like a neat little town, has cheap motels, and is on my route to the Tetons. If all goes well, I should be in western Wyoming by Sunday evening. No clue what my plan will be for the Tetons, Yellowstone, and all that. Hoping for good camping and good weather, but will need to get some research done in the next couple days. So many things to see and do! Karen and I will figure it out as we go.
